# Backup System for Hierarchy Tree View

This folder contains timestamped backups of major changes to `Hierarchy_Tree_View_DEVELOPMENT.js`.

## Backup Naming Convention

`Hierarchy_Tree_View_DEVELOPMENT_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_description.js`

Example: `Hierarchy_Tree_View_DEVELOPMENT_20251022_101203_icons_fixed.js`

## When to Create Backups

**Automatic backups should be created after:**
1. Major bug fixes (e.g., icons appearing, height calculations)
2. Feature additions (e.g., new selection modes, new styling options)
3. Refactoring large sections of code
4. Before and after complex changes
5. When you confirm a fix is working and say "it's done" or "it's fixed"

## How to Create a Backup

You can ask me to create a backup by saying:
- "Create a backup"
- "Save a backup of this working version"
- Or just confirm a fix is working, and I'll automatically create one

## Restoring from Backup

To restore a previous version:
```bash
cp backup/Hierarchy_Tree_View_DEVELOPMENT_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_description.js Hierarchy_Tree_View_DEVELOPMENT.js
```
